# answer before justification
# This ordering is especially effective because it reinforces structured thinking
# â€”first pinpointing a decision, then explicitly rationalizing it, 
# rather than allowing extended reasoning that might bias or distract
# from a definitive prediction.

# most basic approach: just use name, country to predict X
